# Parallel-computing

The goal of this project is to develop faster algorithms for the matrix transposition problem, and also understand the poor cache behavior of 
the na√Øve solution, also for the rest of the project, we are going to have the assumption that both of our matrices SRC, DST respectively 
are stored in the memory in a row-major order
